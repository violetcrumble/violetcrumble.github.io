      <p><strong>Financial analysis and reporting demands placed on Financial 
	  Analysts today are greater than ever before.</strong> Increased regulation and organizational diligence are driving fundamental change in the area of financial modeling and reporting.
Stochastic on stochastic modeling approaches, improved hedging strategies and the need for much more frequent financial reporting has exponentially increased the demands placed on the Actuaries who are burdened with the task of having to develop evermore complex models while also supporting the increasingly complex IT infrastructures required to run these models.</p>

		<p><strong>Attuaris provides fast, dependable, hosted modeling infrastructures for Actuaries.</strong></p>

		<p>Model run failures, out of memory errors, point 'skips', slow performance - The need for a reliable and scalable operating infrastructure to support the specialized needs of the modern Actuarial organization has become critical.</p>  

		<p>Attuaris provides scalable, dedicate environments with unparalleled technical support which allows the 
		Financial Analysts and Actuaries to focus on their core expertise.</p>

  <h2>Escalating Effect</h2>
        <img src="images/relaxed-businessman.jpg" width="410" height="264" alt="Insurance Companies, Financial Modeling, Actuarial Modeling" class="right" />
        <p>Insurance companies have tried to address their ever-increasing modeling demands by throwing hardware at the problem or pushing processing off to &quot;the cloud&quot;. More... better... faster... with little appreciation for the complexities associated with modeling applications. This approach may improve the situation in the short term, but often leads to a less reliable operating environment as the size and complexity of the infrastructure increases.</p>
        <p>Failed runs, inaccurate data, unconfirmed trading strategies and missed deadlines once again become the norm.</p>
        <p>'The cloud' approach relinquishes any control Actuaries may have on scheduled runs as tasks are allocated to idle, but unknown, computers. These can significantly delay the overall run durations and introduce a number of technical challenges which result in more failed runs.</p>
        
        <h2>IT Challenges</h2>
        <p>Managing the modeling IT environment continues to pose the single biggest challenge to the Actuarial departments who are often not equipped to support the ballooning IT infrastructures. Even when the IT departments are involved, they often do not have the specific skills or an appreciation of the application intricacies in order to support the modeling applications.</p>
        
        <h2>'Sticking to your knitting'</h2>
        <p>Attuaris believes that Actuaries are much better suited to focus on their attention on the highly specialized Actuarial activities and separate themselves from the complexities of setting up and managing an technical IT environment. This approach, allows the Actuaries to focus on more important tasks such as:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Model development</li>
        <li>New product development</li>
        <li>M&amp;A activity</li>
        <li>Risk analysis</li>
        <li>Risk mitigation</li>
        <li>More in-depth financial analysis and reporting</li>
        <li>Evaluation and assessment of new regulations and trends</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Our comprehensive hosted infrastructure solution will free the Actuaries from supporting and managing the IT environment and allow Actuaries the time to focus on core Actuarial tasks.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Attuaris understands the frustrations Actuaries live with every day and understands what it takes to get these financial modeling applications running both fast and reliably.</p>
        
        <p>By hosting your infrastructure, you offload these challenges to an organization who truly understands theses applications and also understands and appreciates the complexities of these applications.</p>
